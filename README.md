## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Vision tech enthusiast, who
  - is currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science in Georgia Tech
  - have 3 years of experience working in emerging technology (AR/VR, CV, AI) at Dell Technologies. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Deep Learning frameworks on DeepLearning.AI by Andrew Ng  

ðŸ”­ I have recently completed and published a Virtual Reality research project to investigate the performance of human input (eye-gaze), check it out at this [repo](https://github.com/wenhan9604/Multimodal-Interaction-with-Gaze-and-Controller-Gestures-Testbed)  

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Computer-Vision related projects, ranging from object tracking to classfication.
